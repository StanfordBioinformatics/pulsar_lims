<!--
  Mean to be used in form views. Don't confuse with the _link_to_has_many partial which is meant
  to be used in show views.

  Use this partial in a form view to render a record's links in a has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many
  relationship to display a <ul> with options to remove existing items from the collection. This partial
  will also display any links in any parents for the same type of association (see https://github.com/nathankw/pulsar_lims/wiki/Application-Logic for details on the application logic concerning the terms "parents" and "cloning".

  Required params:
    1. f: A form object created from form_for of simple_form_for.
    2. rec: The model record.
    3. link_name: The association name on the record, i.e. 'documents' for a Model that 'has_many :documents'.

  Optional params:
    1. parent_links: All the parent (ancestral) values for the same type of links. Only makes sense
       to pass if this record has any parents defined by the Cloning#parents instance method defined in
       the model concern at /app/models/concerns/cloning.rb.

  See an example of this partial's use in /app/views/crispr_constructs/_form.html.erb.

  <% if parent_links.any? %>
    <% parent_links.each do |link| %>
      <li><%= link_to link.name, link %></li>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
  <% if rec.id.present? and rec.send(link_name).persisted.any? %>
    <% links = rec.send(link_name).persisted %>
    <%= f.simple_fields_for link_name, links do |ff| %>
      <% cc = links[ff.index] %>
      <li>
        <%= cc.name %>
        <%= ff.input_field :_destroy, as: :boolean, class: "hbtm--remove" %> Remove
      </li>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
</ul>
