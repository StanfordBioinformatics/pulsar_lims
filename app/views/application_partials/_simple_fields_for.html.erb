<!-- This partial is used to list linked records with a checkbox next to each one that allows
the user to remove the link. For example, a Biosample can have many documents. If the user has
selected two documents, but later wants to remove one of the linked documents such that only a single
document is now linked to the biosample record, this partial allows fulfuills that capability. 

The partial renders the linked records in a small table with two fields:
  1. The record name
  2. The checkbox to delete the link if desired. 
  
This partial uses simple_fields_for (https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form), so you must
call accepts_nested_attributes_for in the model that has the has_many association. In our example above, that
means the Biosample model should call accepts_nested_attributes_for and it does indeed do this as 
follows:

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :construct_tags, allow_destroy: true
